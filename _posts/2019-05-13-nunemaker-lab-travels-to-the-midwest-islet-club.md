(May, 2019) Eight members of the Nunemaker Lab traveled to Ann Arbor, Michigan for the 12th annual Midwest Islet Club. Five students presented posters of their research and Nick Whitticar was chosen to give an oral presentation regarding his work on reducing pancreatic islet overactivity. The trip was fully funded by numerous internal funding sources.
