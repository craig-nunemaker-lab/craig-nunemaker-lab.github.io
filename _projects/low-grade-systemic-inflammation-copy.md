Type 1 diabetes (T1D) is a devastating autoimmune disorder resulting in the loss of pancreatic beta-cells. Since beta-cells are the only cells in the body capable of releasing insulin, the loss of these cells results in hyperglycemia that can only be treated by injecting the patient with insulin. By the time T1D is diagnosed, it is estimated that 80-90% of beta-cells have been lost, with the remainder targeted for destruction.&nbsp;

Our lab recently found a compound that may help to treat T1D in two important ways:

1. Stimulate existing cells to secret more insulin.

2. Protect remaining beta-cells from destruction.&nbsp;

1. Identifying what cytokines become elevated early in diabetes and whether they impact islet function.
2. Figuring out how islets from diabetes-prone mice respond so differently to cytokines than islets from normal healthy mice.
3. Identifying new cytokine signaling pathways related to low-grade inflammation.
