### Projects:

Our laboratory studies diabetes at the cellular level. Specifically, we study [pancreatic islets](/projects/islets-of-langerhans) in mouse models of diabetes to identify the earliest possible signs of problems in islet function. We have several ongoing projects in the lab.

1. [Low-grade systemic inflammation](/projects/low-grade-systemic-inflammation) as a trigger of islet dysfunction in type 2 diabetes.
2. [Reducing excessive glycolytic activity](/projects/reducing-excessive-glycolytic-activity-in-early-diabetes) to preserve beta-cell function in improve glycemia in the early stages of type 2 diabetes.
